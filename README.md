# Gans
An example project how to build a data pipeline in the cloud.
It is based on a case study revolving around a fictitious E Scooter company named "Gans". Its business idea is to provide scooters for backpackers coming just off the airplane. Of course bad weather means also bad business for the company. Therefore Gans needs access to both the flight timetable and the weather forecast data. For this purpose a database containing the relevant data will be created and automatically updated at regular intervals.
